# Directory Structure

Previously, in the "Getting Started" section, we showed than a valid DBgen pipeline can be written in 9 lines of code; however, in most real cases, a more complex data pipeline is required.

Let's start by walking through the directory structure of a typical DBgen project. You can get started quickly with a directory structure like this with some boiler plate code by cloning the <a href="https://github.com/modelyst/dbgen-model-template">DBgen cookie cutter repo</a>.
